This is just a barebones clone of [http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

Everyone else in the world seemed to be making one so thought I'd have a go to try and learn a little about C++/SFML and game making as it's not really something I've done before.

It works okay, functional is probably the best word for this code. It's not all that pretty and there's no animations (as I'm yet to read about writing animation code). But it is kind of playable. Not bad for a C++/game first attempt in an afternoon.

If you're so bored that you want to compile this the only dependency is [SFML 2.1](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.1/)
